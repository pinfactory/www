Demos are hard.  They take a long time to set up, you have to reconfigure them for last-minute software changes, and somehow, demos seem to break anyway.  Time to change that.  The good news is that software developers have figured most of this out already.

This talk will cover the basics of turning your software demo into a software project. We’ll cover how to save time, reduce risk, and increase a demo’s socks-knocking-off factor by using version control, test-driven development, and other stuff borrowed from “real” software work.

We’ll use the system package manager to create demo packages with sample data and setup/teardown scripts, along with Docker for building demo containers and Capstan to build run-anywhere VMs.  And we’ll finish up with a compendium of embarrassing demo stories and how we prepare to avoid those situations in the future.
